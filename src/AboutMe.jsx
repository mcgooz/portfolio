                        <p>Hi, I'm Richard Hughes, a software developer based in Barcelona.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            I have always been a curious, hands-on, problem-solving type. When the family PC went wrong, I would take pleasure in troubleshooting it, trying to understand those cryptic blue-screen messages. 
                            Later, when I built my own PCs for music production, I would gladly spend countless hours solving driver issues, hunting down dodgy plug-ins, and optimising everything I could. 
                            Fortunately, even Windows PCs are a lot more stable these days so I can focus on the fun stuff!
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            I began my coding journey in November 2023. A friend, well-aware of my technical mindset and apparent knack for human languages, suggested that I give it a go, that I might enjoy it. 
                            They weren't wrong! I caught the bug and I have since completed three Harvard CS50 courses, an IBM full-stack diploma, several personal projects, and I've tried my hardest to write good unit tests.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            But it's not just what's under the hood that matters. 
                            I have a keen eye for detail, a (subjectively) cool style, and the adaptability to listen, consider and learn whatever's needed. 
                            I'm as comfortable diving into code as I am thinking about the overall look, feel, and flow of a project.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Today, I'm skilled in Python and JavaScript, along with their key libraries and frameworks. 
                            I enjoy building practical, well-structured solutions and am always looking to improve my craft and the projects I work on.
                        </p>
